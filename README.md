# Big2-AI-Monte-Carlo
This repository implements an AI-driven system for the card game Big2 using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The project includes four AI versions (AI 1.0 to AI 4.0), each improving in strategy complexityâ€”from card superiority analysis to opponent movement prediction and dynamic adjustments.
